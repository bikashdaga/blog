    <h1 class="post-title">About Me</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hi! My name is Ashton Sidhu and I’m currently a Data Scientist focused in the cyber security area. I’m an engineer at heart and have both a Bachelors of Applied Science and Engineering as well as a Master’s of Engineering focused in Information Systems as well as Predictive and Perscriptive analytics.</p>

<p>I pride myself on being a swiss army knife engineer and being able to be self sufficient. I’ve been a software developer leading and delivering production releases of applications, I’ve also done ETL work, ingesting raw data and storing it into a Data Lake or Warehouse. I’ve also automated the deployment of infrastructure as well as deploy machine learning models into applications as well as production. I’ve always been naturally curious and had this drive be able to learn and do everything. It keeps me motivated to this day and allows me to experiment more freely as well as building my own software, application or product end to end.</p>

<h1 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h1>

<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>

<p>Sports have always been a big part of my life since I was a kid, from playing high level baseball or sitting at home watching the Toronto Maple Leafs with the entire family (I used to cry when I was a kid when they lost in the playoffs). I played Baseball at the city level and pretty much everything else recreationally since I was a kid.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I find watching sports during the regular season difficult. As ironic as it may be, I think analytics has taken away the watchability of some sports. With hockey specifically, the game in the past used to be alot more free flowing and less structured compared to today’s games. I understand that this was going to be the natural evolution of sports as more data became accessible, but nonetheless, not the same as it used to be. Wow, am I getting old?</p>

<h2 id="played">Played</h2>

<p>Baseball: INF + Pitcher
Hockey (Ball): Goalie + Defence
Football: TE
Soccer: Goalie
Basketball: SG + SF
Favorite Teams
Baseball: Blue Jays
Hockey: Toronto Maple Leafs
Football: Oakland Raiders, Green Bay Packers (Aaron Rodgers), Kansas City Chiefs (Patrick Mahomes)
Soccer: Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool
Basketball: Toronto Raptors, Lebron James</p>

<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>

<p>I experiment with a lot of tech on my free time, specifically automation. I’ve set up my own home infrastructure to automate and aggegrate a lot of day to day tasks. I also experiment with infrastructure (I’m afraid to leave machines running on the cloud and get wopped with a huge bill.) and run a lot of my own on prem solutions. I run my own Spark cluster, data storages (Hadoop, Cassandra, ELK, etc.), Jupyter Server, Zeppelin, Kafka, etc for any analytics, monitoring, or ETL processes that I have throughout my place.</p>

<p>I also experiment with machine learning, specifically in the cyber security space, both on the defensive and offensive side. Those ideas can be seen and replicated through the blog posts on my site, so check them out.</p>

<p>Other than analytics, I also do some Hacker One as well as Hack the Box.</p>

<h2 id="gaming">Gaming</h2>

<p>I’ve been gaming since I was a kid on the original Gameboy playing Pokemon. I started as a PC Gamer with Runescape and Maplestory. Then moved to the PS3 to play CoD MW2 and then when League of Legends came out and took over the industry when I was in first year university .. well ya. I picked up CS: GO around 3rd year university, played in some amateur tournaments and took home some money. Then I retired from my E-sports career shortly after while on top… Anyways, now I just game casually on my free time.</p>

<p>Guild Wars 2
CS: GO
Civilization 6</p>

<h2 id="music">Music</h2>

<p>Who doesn’t like music? It’s fair to say that music plays a portion in everyone’s life whether it’s art or recreational. For me, studying music in university was my first option. When I first started even just in choir, I was terrible, always off key and couldn’t keep a rhythm to save my life. Then I picked up the Alto Sax, which I was just as terrible as when I first started. I was the last kid in my class to even just get a sound out of it.</p>

<p>Around Grade 9 is when everything changed and it turns out I had some skill and a passion for it. I made the decision that I wanted to study Performance Music in university. At this point I had made my mind up that I wanted to go the University of Toronto because at the time it was the best school in Canada (it might still be, I don’t keep up with the rankings anymore.). If I didn’t get into U of T for music, I was going to go there for Engineering Science. I managed to get the professor who teaches Alto Sax at U of T for Performance Music as my teacher and ultimately didn’t get in.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve performed in 1 or 2 concerts and was the Alto Sax player for the engineering production Skule Nite for 5 years. Some of the greatest memories of my life.</p>

<h2 id="fun-facts">Fun Facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>My first dream job was a Hockey commentator. I used to play mini sticks by myself and commentate the games.</li>
  <li>I once serenaded McMaster university with “Careless Whisper”. There’s a video of it on the internet somewhere.</li>
  <li>I was once a ranked chess player in Ontario. Used to compete in tournaments.</li>
  <li>Latin music is my favourite genre. Although once I had an EDM phase.</li>
  <li>Turns out, I’ve never travelled to a different timezone. It’s still one of my goals to see the world.</li>
